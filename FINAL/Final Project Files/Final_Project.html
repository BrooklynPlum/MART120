        <h3>~~~~~My first "coding" project using Code.org~~~~~</h3>
        <p>
            This was my first instance of coding in this class. It was created with a Code.org tutorial, using blocks of code to trace out the "horse" shape.

        <h3>~~~~~Using Scratch: Space Dog and Wizard Toad~~~~~</h3>
        <p>
            This project was created using Scratch. Similar to Code.org, I used blocks of code to effect the sprites, backgrounds, timing, music and dialogue.
            I was also able to edit the sprites in order to animate them.

        <h3>~~~~~More Code.org: Making Games~~~~~</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            This week's assignment was to create two games of different types, once again using blocks of code in Code.org. The first, "Aliens on the Courts!", uses
            the WASD keys to control the character. Alien sprites are set to flee from the players position and the goal is to collide with each of the aliens until
            they're all gone.
            <br>
            The second, "Choose Your Own Dino Adventure", is a text-based choose your own adventure game using blocks of code to take the player to a different page
            depending on the button they choose to press. This one was really fun to make, although the first, more complex rendtion was erased so the version that
            you see here is a more condensed version.

        <h2>WEEK 5</h2>
        <h3>~~~~~Using Alice!~~~~~</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Alice was my favorite of these platforms to work on. It also operated using blocks of code, but it was a bit more complicated. I also enjoyed the process of
            building the "set". It crashed a few times and was a little bit clunky to work with, but overall it was really fun use.
