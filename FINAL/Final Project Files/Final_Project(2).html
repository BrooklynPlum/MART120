        <h2>WEEKS 6, 7, 8</h2>
        <h3>~~~~~Using HTML and CSS: Creating a Webpage~~~~~</h3>
        <p>
            These weeks served as my introduction to using HTML and CSS. We were tasked with creating three webpages, one with a few facts, one with a story, and one with a
            form to be filled out. The first week consisted of just formatting all the information (shown in the first and second pictures), the weeks after we used style tags, 
            CSS and CDNs to design and alter the UI aspects (shown in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth pictures).

        <h3>~~~~~Using JavaScript: Self Portrait~~~~~</h3>
        <p>
            Next we used HTML and JavaScript to create a canvas and make "art". The first week was spent learning some basics in JavaScript, like how to create shapes.
            In the next week we went a little deeper, learning things like how create movement by adding and subtracting from variables.

        <h2>WEEKS 11, 12</h2>
        <h3>~~~~~Using JavaScript: Making a Basic Game~~~~~</h3>
        <p>
            During these two weeks we used JavaScript to create a game that someone could interact with. We learned how to assign meaning to actions using functions like
            keyPressed and mouseClicked, and how to implement "winning conditions". I created the same game twice, using two different configurations of things like 
            functions.

        <h3>~~~~~More JavaScript: Another Game, Using Arrays~~~~~</h3>
        <p>
            During the final week, we were tasked with creating another game in JavaScript. This one would use arrays to create numerous shapes with more ease
            although many of the other elements are the same as the previous game.
